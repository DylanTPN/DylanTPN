<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Dylan</h1>
<h3 align="center">I've spent the last 6 years working in logistics. Over the years, I have developed a strong skill set in operations management, process optimization, and problem-solving. However, my passion for technology and continuous improvement has led me to pursue a career in the IT sector. I am currently learning to code and explore various technologies to make the transition from logistics to software development.</h3>
